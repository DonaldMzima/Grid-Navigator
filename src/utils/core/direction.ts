 * Function/algorithm that does the computation
 * adding subtracting the numbers of blocks .
 *
 *  - write script/code that determines north, west, south, and east
 *  - then based on the first direction (meaning the block you are instructed to travel), that becomes your starting point i.e if ["L3", "R5"], "L3" is your starting posting, going east 3 blocks
 *  - we would have separate "L3" to get the L for direction then get the number of blocks which is "3"
 *  - is to loop/go through the rest of the list (meaning we exclude the initial point, since we already have it)
 *  - based on the initial point we determine what the directions are moving forward (nested function , that determines if the next step based on the previous step, if it is north, south, east or west)
